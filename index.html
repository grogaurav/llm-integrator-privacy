# Privacy Policy — LLM Integrator (Chrome Extension)<br/>
**Effective date:** 2025-08-08<br/>
<br/>
LLM Integrator is a Chrome extension that analyzes the **currently active web page** using a Large Language Model (LLM) chosen by you (OpenAI or Google Gemini). This policy explains what data is handled, where it goes, and the controls you have.<br/>
<br/>
## TL;DR<br/>
- We **do not collect**, sell, or monetize your data.<br/>
- Your **API keys and settings are stored locally** on your device (via `chrome.storage.local`).  <br/>
- Page text is captured **only when you click Analyze**, then **sent directly** from your browser to the LLM provider you selected to generate a response.<br/>
- We do **not run remote code**. We call the provider’s HTTPS APIs and display the response.<br/>
- Uninstalling the extension removes its local storage.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
## Who we are<br/>
**Publisher:** Gaurav Patil  <br/>
**Contact:** grogaurav@gmail.com<br/>
<br/>
## What the extension does<br/>
When you click **Analyze**, the extension gathers visible text on the current page (headings, paragraphs, and list items), optionally trims it to your configured word limit, combines it with your prompt, and sends it to **the LLM API you chose**. The model’s response is shown in the extension popup and the DevTools panel and logged to the page Console.<br/>
<br/>
## Data we handle<br/>
We keep things minimal and local by default.<br/>
<br/>
### 1) Data you enter<br/>
- **Prompts** (per run) — used to generate the response.  <br/>
- **API keys** for OpenAI or Google Generative Language — stored **locally** via `chrome.storage.local` so the extension can call the chosen API. They are **not transmitted** to the developer.<br/>
<br/>
### 2) Page content<br/>
- **What**: Visible text content from the active tab (headings, paragraphs, list items).  <br/>
- **When**: Only after you click **Analyze**.  <br/>
- **Where it goes**: Sent **directly** to the LLM provider you selected to fulfill your request.  <br/>
- **Not kept by us**: We (the developer) do not receive, store, or log this content.<br/>
<br/>
### 3) Settings<br/>
- Provider/model/temperature, word and token limits, and your last 5 prompts are stored **locally** in `chrome.storage.local` to make the tool easy to reuse.<br/>
<br/>
### 4) Analytics, tracking, and ads<br/>
- **None.** The extension does not include analytics, trackers, or advertising.<br/>
<br/>
## Where your data goes (third parties)<br/>
When you click **Analyze**, your prompt and the collected page text are sent from your device to the **LLM API endpoint you selected** (e.g., OpenAI or Google Generative Language). Those providers will process that data under their own terms and privacy policies. Review and configure your provider account settings to your preference. The developer of LLM Integrator does **not** operate intermediary servers or proxy your requests.<br/>
<br/>
## Permissions justification<br/>
- **activeTab** — Needed to operate only on the tab you’re viewing when you click **Analyze**. No broad/background access.  <br/>
- **tabs** — Used by the popup to read the active tab ID so the analysis can target that tab. No history is read or stored.  <br/>
- **scripting** — Injects a short, on-demand function that collects visible text for analysis; nothing persists after it runs.  <br/>
- **storage** — Saves your local settings, API keys, and recent prompts in `chrome.storage.local`.  <br/>
- **Host permissions** (`https://api.openai.com/*`, `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*`) — Required to call the selected LLM provider’s API over HTTPS.<br/>
<br/>
## Data retention<br/>
- **Local storage:** Settings, API keys, and prompt history remain on your device until you edit them or uninstall the extension.  <br/>
- **Off-device processing:** Your prompt and page text are transmitted to the selected LLM provider only to produce the response. We do not control those providers’ retention policies; please consult your provider’s documentation.<br/>
<br/>
## Security<br/>
- API calls are made over **HTTPS**.  <br/>
- API keys are stored in Chrome’s **local extension storage** on your device. Local storage is not encrypted by the extension, so safeguard your device and browser profile. Avoid sharing your machine or syncing keys across profiles you don’t control.<br/>
<br/>
## Your choices &amp; controls<br/>
- **Change provider or model** anytime in Options.  <br/>
- **Remove keys or settings** by clearing the fields in Options and clicking **Save**.  <br/>
- **Delete all local data** by uninstalling the extension (this removes its local storage).  <br/>
- **Do not analyze** pages that contain sensitive or confidential information if you don’t want that content sent to an LLM provider.<br/>
<br/>
## Children’s privacy<br/>
This extension is intended for general audiences and is **not directed to children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.<br/>
<br/>
## Changes to this policy<br/>
We may update this policy if features or data flows change. When we do, we’ll revise the “Effective date” above. Material changes will be highlighted in the store listing.<br/>
